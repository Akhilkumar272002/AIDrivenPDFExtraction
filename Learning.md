# This is the Learning, Outcomes and Processes Followed during this Projects.

---

## Process

The Project is been seperate into three main Process Parts:

- `PDF Extraction`

- `Data Validation with AI`

- `AI Model Integration`

  ### In PDF Extraction

    ```Text

    - To extract text, Image, Bordered Table from a PDF to JSON value
    - To extract the Borderless Table with best accuracy and integrate with whole code 
    
    ```

  ### In Data Validation with AI

    ```Text
    - We will use the model to evaluate the data extraction from PDF to JSON (under review)  
    ```

  ### In AI Model Integration

    ```Text
    - we will use the extracted data from the PDF and use the model to reterive organisation sepcific templates
    ```
